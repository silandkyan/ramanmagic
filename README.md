# ramanmagic
A collection of small tools for analyzing Raman spectra of geomaterials. It contains the following tools:


## plot_spectrum.py
Simple spectrum plotting. You can crop the data to plot by specifying lower and upper wavenumber (= x-axis) bounds.

## ifors_analysis
For further analyzing fitting data generated by the IFORS software package by Keno LÃ¼nsdorf.

plot_temp_distribution.py takes temperature data generated by IFORS, plots them nicely and calculates some sample statistics.

ifors_analysis.py does more complicated things...

## simple_fitting
simple_fitting provides routines for simple spectrum fitting jobs. It uses the lmfit library, which is a critical requirement.

qz_std_fit.py for quartz reference material spectra.

qz_incl_fit.py for spectra of quartz inclusions within a garnet host crystal.

fitting_readout.py for parsing the output of the fitting scripts and bringing them into a more useable form for further analysis.

## data
This folder contains example data files for the above jobs.
